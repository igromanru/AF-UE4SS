[url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS]UE4SS[/url] (Unreal Engine 4/5 Scripting System) bundle with the necessary configurations to make it work with the latest Abiotic Factor version.
I give each bundle a separate version from the current UE4SS version to better track changes and signal updates.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Manual Installation[/b][/size][/font]
[size=1]As for now Vortex doesn't support the game, so you have to install everything manually.[/size]
1. Download the latest bundle from [b]Files[/b] page
2. Extract/unzip the zip file
3. Move and overwrite the [b]dwmapi.dll[/b] and the whole [b]ue4ss[/b] folder to the directory: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i].
[size=2]For Steam users it's usually: [b]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/b]
For MS Store, something like: [b]C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PlayStack.AbioticFactor_1.0.20061.0_x64__3wcqaesafpzfy\AbioticFactor\Binaries\WinGDK[/b][/size]
4. Verify that the [b]dwmapi.dll[/b] and [b]ue4ss[/b] folder are in the same directory as the [b]AbioticFactor-Win64-Shipping.exe[/b]
See [url=https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/6412/images/35/35-1731950649-2140736488.png]Screenshot[/url].
5. Done, you can download and install mods now.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Dedicated Server Support[/b][/size][/font]
For UE4SS to work in a Dedicated Server, you have to replace the loader, [i]dwmapi.dll[/i] with [b]version.dll[/b] from [i]Optional Files[/i] in Files tab.
On Linux UE4SS needs Windows environment to run, you need either Proton or at least Wine.
And to add the following command as launch option:
[code]WINEDLLOVERRIDES="version.dll=n,b" %command%
[/code]
[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Delete crash dumps sometimes[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]Sadly, the know crashes (see Known Issues below) probably won't be fixed anytime soon. Therefore, I recommend deleting game's crash dumps once in a while to free space.[/size]
1. Navigate into [i]C:\Users\(your windows username here)\AppData\Local\AbioticFactor\Saved\[/i]
[size=2]Copy and paste into explorer: [b]%userprofile%\AppData\Local\AbioticFactor\Saved\[/b][/size]
2. Delete the whole [b]Crashes[/b] folder.
3. Done. [size=2]You can do it like once a month, they don't take much space.[/size]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Known Issues[/b][/size][/font]
[list]
[*]Random game crashes when loading into game, leaving to main menu or closing the game. (It's annoying but shouldn't impact the game play)
[*]Sometimes a registered hotkey from any mod can cause a crash. Usually if you press the hotkey without issues it stays this way until the next game start.
[/list]
