[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Description[/b][/size][/font]
[url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS]UE4SS[/url] (Unreal Engine 4/5 Scripting System) bundle with the necessary configurations to make it work with the latest Abiotic Factor version.
I give each bundle a separate version from the current UE4SS version to better track changes and signal updates.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Manual Installation[/b][/size][/font]
[size=1]As for now Vortex doesn't support the game, so you have to install everything manually.[/size]
1. Download the latest bundle from [b]Files[/b] page
2. Extract/unzip the zip file
3. Move and overwrite the [b]dwmapi.dll[/b] and the whole [b]ue4ss[/b] folder to the directory: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i].
[size=2]For Steam users it's usually: [b]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/b][/size]
4. Verify that the [b]dwmapi.dll[/b] and [b]ue4ss[/b] folder are in the same directory as the [b]AbioticFactor-Win64-Shipping.exe[/b]
See [url=https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/6412/images/35/35-1726785869-193872018.png]Screenshot[/url].
5. Done, you can download and install mods now.
This is how ue4ss directory should look like: [url=https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/6412/images/35/35-1726786031-1393126728.png]Screenshot[/url]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Directories[/b][/size][/font]
[size=3]All UE4SS relevant files are now in the [b]ue4ss[/b] directory![/size]
[b]Mods:[/b] [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\[/i]
[b]mods.txt:[/b] [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\mods.txt[/i]
[b]Settings:[/b] [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\UE4SS-settings.ini[/i]
[b]Log file:[/b] [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\UE4SS.log[/i]

Not all mod descriptions might be up to date! You have to put all UE4SS mods into the [b]\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\[/b] directory, even if the mod says [i]\Win64\Mods\[/i].

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Migration from older UE4SS[/b][/size][/font]
To migrate from the release version of UE4SS you just have to move all installed mods from [i]\Win64\Mods\[/i] to [i]\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\[/i] directory (see Directories section above).
Don't forget to migrate the [b]mods.txt[/b] changes as well.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Known Issues[/b][/size][/font]
[list]
[*]Random game crashes when loading into game, leaving to main menu or closing the game. (It's annoying but shouldn't impact the game play)
[*]Sometimes a registered hotkey from any mod can cause a crash. Usually if you press the hotkey without issues it stays this way until the next game start.
